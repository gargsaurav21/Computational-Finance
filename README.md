# ComputationalFinance Repository

Welcome to the **ComputationalFinance** repositoryâ€”a hands-on companion to Lech Grzelakâ€™s **Computational Finance** YouTube course. This collection unifies his original Python scripts with enriched notebooks that deepen your understanding of financial models and numerical methods.

### ðŸ“Œ About
This repository includes:  
- **Lechâ€™s Original Code**  
  Authentic scripts (either identical or lightly refactored) directly from the course.  
- **Enhanced Notebooks & Scripts**  
  Supplementary files featuring:
  - Clear mathematical derivations at the top of each notebook  
  - Inline commentary linking theory to code  
  - Extended examples and visualizations  

### ðŸ“š Course Content
The lecture number is stated as the first letter of the notebook:

2. Stocks, Options, and Stochastic Processes  
3. Option Pricing and Simulation in Python  
4. Implied Volatility
5. Jump Processes  
6. Affine Jump Diffusion Models  
7. Stochastic Volatility Models  
8. Fourier Transform Methods for Option Pricing  
9. Monte Carlo Simulation Techniques  
10. Monte Carlo Simulation of the Heston Model  
11. Hedging and Monte Carlo Greeks  
12. Forward Start Options and the Bates Model  
13. Exotic Derivatives  

### ðŸš€ Key Features
- Lecture-aligned notebooks with **Enhanced Insight** sections  
- Step-by-step derivations 
- Advanced Python implementations
- Interactive charts illustrating model behavior under varying parameters

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To serve as a practical learning resource, bridging theory and code for students, researchers, and practitioners exploring computational finance with Python.

### ðŸ“¢ Acknowledgments
Huge thanks to **Lech Grzelak** for creating the **Computational Finance** lecture series and sharing all original code. This repository builds upon his invaluable work.
