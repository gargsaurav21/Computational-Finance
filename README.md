# ComputationalFinance Repository  

A collection of quantitative finance models and numerical methods in Python, developed as an extension of Lech Grzelakâ€™s Computational Finance course.  

ðŸ”¹ Combines original scripts with **enhanced Jupyter notebooks** that add:  
- Clear mathematical derivations for key models  
- Inline commentary linking theory to trading/risk applications  
- Extended examples and interactive visualizations  

ðŸ“ˆ Topics covered include:  
- Option pricing and simulation  
- Implied volatility and jump processes  
- Stochastic volatility and affine models  
- Fourier transform methods for derivatives pricing  
- Monte Carlo simulations (Heston, Bates)  
- Greeks and hedging techniques  
- Exotic derivatives  

ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**: To bridge theory and practical implementation, providing a resource for traders, risk managers, and quants exploring computational finance with Python.
