# ComputationalFinance Repository

Welcome to the **ComputationalFinance** repository! This collection contains Python code inspired by the **Computational Finance** course on YouTube by Lech Grzelak. 

### ðŸ“Œ About
This repository includes:
- **Original course code** from Lech (either identical or slightly modified).
- **Additional files** created for deeper exploration, featuring detailed explanations and mathematical derivations at the top of each script.

#### Content of the course:
